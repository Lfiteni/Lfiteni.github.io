            <h5>This new Eau de Parfum builds on the legacy of the Eau de Toilette with a sensual new scent. Inspired by the earthy, rugged landscape of Tuscany, renowned perfumers Daphné Bugey and Nathalie Lorson have reinterpreted the original fragrance to evoke the intense and magnetic sides of this king of everyday life. Ignited by fiery aromatics and underpinned by noble woods, K by Dolce&Gabbana Eau de Parfum is spicey, strong and bold with a rich woody base.</h5>
            <p>
            <h5>This strong fragrance undoubtedly needs a strong man to represent it. Friend of the brand Mariano Di Vaio perfectly embodies that strong values of this scent with his approach to modern masculinity and family traditions. The dad of three grew up close to the Tuscan hillside where the campaign for this fragrance was shot and the area holds a special place in his heart. The actor and model has partnered with the brand for several years and his proud Italian values are closely aligned with Dolce&Gabbana. We talk to Di Vaio to find out more about this new scent and what it represents to him.</h5>
            <p>
            <h5>As a man what do you look for in a fragrance?
            When I choose a fragrance, I want something that will reflect my bold personality and boost my confidence. Therefore, I usually go for something unique, yet refined. I love woody notes as we have in K by Dolce&Gabbana Eau de Parfum with its base of Nagarmotha Wood.</h5>
            <p>
            <h5>What image does the K by Dolce&Gabbana scent evoke for you?

                K by Dolce&Gabbana is such an empowering scent. For me, it evokes an image of the rugged landscapes of my homeland, Italy.
                
                Who is the man you envision wearing this scent?
                
                The man I imagine wearing K by Dolce&Gabbana is true to his roots, he follows his own path and owns his crown. He is a modern, successful man, self-confident but humble – just like the fragrance is intense, yet refined. In summary, he is the king of his everyday life!
