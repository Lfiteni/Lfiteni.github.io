            The New York experience was determining. When he returned to Italy in 2011, he bought his first camera and opened the blog Mdvstyle in which he talked about his daily life, and his looks and wrote about cinema and fashion. He collected considerable success becoming one of the most important Italian bloggers and beyond. In fact, in 2015 he was awarded the Best men’s fashion blog award at the Stylight Fashion Influencer Awards of Berlin Fashion Week.
            He began to earn international fame also working as a model for some important fashion houses: Roberto Cavalli, Hugo Boss, Gucci, Tommy Hilfiger, Omega, Cruciani, and Diesel.

            In 2016 he published his first book, My dream job, published by Mondadori Electa in which he talks about his professional and personal journey. In 2017 he married Eleonora Brunacci, a lawyer and collaborator with whom he had three children. Brunacci created a line of accessories and bijoux for NoHow.

            2018 was the year in which his success was established: Forbes magazine placed him in first place in the ranking of the most influential Under 30 in the world in the clothing e-commerce sector. This recognition, as declared by Di Vaio himself, identified him not only as a model and fashion blogger but as an entrepreneur.

            After walking the catwalk twice for the Italian brand  Dolce&Gabbana, in 2019 he became the face of the international perfume campaign K by Dolce&Gabbana.

            In 2014 he founded NoHow – of which he is the creative director and CEO -, multi-brand e-commerce in which pieces of the MDV collection are sold but also international brands such as Reebok, Lacoste, Colmar, Calvin Klein, Adidas, and The North Face. The company is based in Umbria and, in 2020, it recorded a turnover of 10 million euros. MDV Collection offers exclusively male garments that reflect the casual style of Mariano Di Vaio, combining practicality with elegance.
